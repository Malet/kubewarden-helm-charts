# Kubewarden

[Kubewarden](https://kubewarden.io) makes it very easy to write and
distribute Kubernetes admission and mutation policies using your
preferred languages and frameworks, as well-known distribution methods
for policies.

It is powered by [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), so
Kubewarden policies are processor, architecture and OS agnostic.

Download policies or build your own once, and run it everywhere, no
matter what the system is.
